# SciFiTaxi
Hi all!<br>
This is my demo project for Unity. <br>
Sci Fi Taxi based on the movie 5th element. You play as Corben Dallas and once you get Leloo, you have to run so fast as you can.<br>
Here is no win or lose conditions<br>

<br>
The world is infinite and dynamically generated.<br>
There are also traffic flows in the city. Cars will avoid collisions<br>
Police cars will try to catch you<br>
All my code you can find in Assets/Scripts folder<br>
This project uses asset "POLY STYLE - Sci-Fi City Customizable Pack" for information purposes only and is not supposed for commercial use.<br>
to start game, open Scenes/main.unity
